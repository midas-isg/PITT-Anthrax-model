An anthrax compartmental model developed by the University of Pittsburgh. The model is based on the model described in the paper: [The Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies to Reduce Mortality From an Intentional Release of Aerosolized Anthrax Spores (RS Braithwaite et al)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0272989x06286794).

The model supports the following control strategies: antibiotic prophylaxis of susceptible individuals in the population, hospitalization with administration of intravenous antibiotics to symptomatic individuals, and treatment in the I.C.U. for fulminant
